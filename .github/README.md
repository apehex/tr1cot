# tr1cot

Apply diffusion on language using regular vision models.
Text samples are folded on themselves and entangled like wool balls, hence the name "tricot" for "knitting".

Folding follows the path of a space filling curve, typically the Hilbert curve.

## Installation

The package is available on pypi:
